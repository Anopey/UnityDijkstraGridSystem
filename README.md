You can drag these scripts into your Unity project and use them freely as long as you abide by the MIT license provided herein. Do not forget to add the GameProperties, LateExecutor and GameManager to their respective gameobjects and modify the script orders such that (from initial to latter): GameProperties -> GameManager-> your stuff to be initialized -> LateExecutor. 

Feel free to add the code of the scripts to your scripts and modify them however you would like
